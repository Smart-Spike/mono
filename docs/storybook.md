# Storybook

To run storybook `yarn storybook` from the project or `npx lerna exec scope=` from the root

### Addons to explore

Storybook has a [gallery of addons](https://storybook.js.org/addons/addon-gallery/), some of which are maintained by the storybook team and some by the community - but here are a few which I think could be useful to us...

[Viewport](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/tree/release/3.4/addons/viewport) - toggle viewport by device / screen resolution

[Storyshots](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/tree/release/3.4/addons/storyshots) - add jest snapshots of stories

[Figma](https://github.com/hharnisc/storybook-addon-figma) - embed figma designs to stories

[styled component theme](https://github.com/echoulen/storybook-addon-styled-component-theme)
